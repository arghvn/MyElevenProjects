 next we will build s api using GO 
 we will have something called as a movie server which will give us the list of all movies and we can create update and delete ...
 its name is crud and crud stands for this server.
 we dont have database here and we use strucs and slices in localhost  8000 

 we will have five different routes : get all , get by id , create , update and delete
 Each path will have a function that uses methods to display a movie
 
 functions for each routes :
 We define these five functions in the main section.

get all , getmovies
get by id , getmovie
create , createmovie
update , updatemovie
delete , deletemovie

there are two types of endpoints slash /movies and /movies/id
we have to use depending on what we are doing in the sense ,if we are creating
then obviously /m if we are updating then obviously id is required so it has to be /m/i right then. 

and there are methods and there are getmethods...get fo get all and get by id function and we will use post (another method)
for create function and we will use put for update  function and we will use delete for delete function.

and we wil using postman to test all these endpoints.

what is the rest Api ?
REST is an "architectural style" or "design template" for APIs.
Various applications and web pages are used to obtain information about various sources.
Where does this data come from? This data is received from servers and applications are connected to web servers to receive and send data.
A REST API is a way to connect two computer systems, such as a web browser and servers, via HTTP.
APIâ€Œ is the title for the "Application Programming Interface".
An API is an intermediary that allows communication between two applications.


log uses for searching errors to connecting server
encoding/json uses for encoding
math/rand : imagine the user adds a new  movie to this movie server so we need to create a new ID for it and
that will be created using math/rand 
net/http allows to create a server in GO 
strconv = string conversion 
The index created with math / rand will be an integer and needs to be converted to a string.


postman :
Postman makes it very easy for us to test, execute, and test written WebAPI code and methods.
In the programming environment, when we implement a Web API to test it in the same environment, we have to write client-side code that we can check its output, that is, we have to simulate the original code that we are going to write, but always do This is not cost-effective for us in terms of time, and we like to see the output of our program very quickly, and when we change our code, we can easily see the output and the result of our changes. Also, sometimes testing the output by the main program is a difficult and challenging task. So having an interface software for this is very efficient and using it will help us.

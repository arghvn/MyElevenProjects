 next we will build s api using GO 
 we will have something called as a movie server which will give us the list of all movies and we can create update and delete ...
 its name is crud and crud stands for this server.
 we dont have database here and we use strucs and slices in localhost  8000 

 we will have five different routes : get all , get by id , create , update and delete
 Each path will have a function that uses methods to display a movie

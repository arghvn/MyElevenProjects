creating a bot for calcualting age by using GO

at first we create an account in api.salck.com 
and in app section we create new app from scratch by name age-bot in Myrl Tech workspace 
in socket mode section we create socke-token instead token name

we can in add bot user event add another properties to our bot like history and message.im (for reading messages)and 
messages.channel and messages.mpin ...
if we use a lot of this properties , an error reduce in our app

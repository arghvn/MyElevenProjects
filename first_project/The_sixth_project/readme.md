building an email verifier tool 

after making this code if we write go run main.go in terminal we have a statement domain,hasMX,hasSPF,spfRecord,hasDMARC,dmarRecord thath says 
when you enter a domain name right now it will give you the doamin name and check it and mx records...
and by checking these then we will know if that domain is right from which that email id is come out from to or not
so youll just check the domain

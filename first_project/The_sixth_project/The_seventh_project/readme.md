The seventh project

we try to create a LAMBDA function using GO
lambda(a serverless technology) runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging

in lambda we create functions and host them on the cloud
we want create an api that can be exposed to the public and those we will create using lambda

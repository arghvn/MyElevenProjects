MongoDB database instead of using tables and rows in traditional database systems
Data interfaces, MongoDB uses collections (Collection) and documents (Document).
Documents consist of key-value pairs, which are the fundamental data units in MongoDB
are counted
 Collections include sets of documents and functions that are equivalent
Tables are relational databases.
MongoDB is considered a NoSQL tool, that is, in this database management system, the common rows and columns used in relational database systems are not used.
MongoDB has an architecture that uses collections and documents. The basic unit of data in this type of database includes sets of key-value pairs. In MongoDB it is possible for documents to have different fields and structures. In the MongoDB database, a document-oriented storage format called BSON is used, which is a binary type of JSON documents.

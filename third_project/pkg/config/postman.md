work with postman 

in collection we create a new collection named BookStore

in BookStore collection we create a request named Get All and another requests named Create ,Get By Id ,Update ,Delete

for Get All we need localhost 9010/book/
in  Get All we get an empty array (each book considered an empty book )

for using body we have to send json and a json will have three fields are name ,author ,publication
name of the book is 'zero to one' and author is peter thiel from penguin publication , id3

if we send it we will get a response that the info saved correctly 

in front of name ,author and publication we can delete last info and write new info about another book
secend book = start up way ,eric , penguin , id4

update book do with update (id4 instead id3)
